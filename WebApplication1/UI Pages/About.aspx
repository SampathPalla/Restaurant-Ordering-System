    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>People go to restaurants for a great dining experience instead many a time they are encountered
        with an unfamiliar menu, inefficient staff service, and long wait times. What if they had a more
        descriptive menu, a waiter freely available when needed, and the flexibility to conveniently
        place, change and cancel orders? Our proposal exactly does this by solving most of the problems
        associated with a paper menu and the traditional way of ordering in a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to automate the ordering process at a restaurant by an application that provides the basic
        services of a normal waiter, with additional features and flexibility. This application would
        feature an interactive menu allowing customers to browse and search through items by different
        categories or even customer ratings. It would also provide suggestions for drinks and desserts.
        Through this application, there is always accessible service, so customers can order whenever
        they want. The inputted order can also be catered to their specific tastes and eating habits. Bill
        payment can be done at their own leisure too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, the automated menu service would be a touch-screen monitor positioned at each table
        allowing customers easy access to restaurant services at any time. This could also be done
        through the customer’s smartphone. Our intention is to use the automated menu service as a
        mediator between customers and restaurant owners, promoting a mutually beneficial
        relationship. By improving the dining experience, diners will leave the restaurant satisfied. He
        or she will then be more likely to recommend the restaurant, thus translating into higher revenue.
        Increased customer satisfaction also means future visits and personal referrals.    </p>
